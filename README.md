# Arena

Documents for the arenas at Student Robotics competitions.

Each competition/year has its own folder and `Makefile`, though typical dependencies are:

* [`make`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/release/)
* [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)

Usually these will be available via standard package distribution channels.
`make` and Ghostscript may be pre-installed on some operating systems.
